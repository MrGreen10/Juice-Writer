# Note For All Versions
When downloading the application, antivirus software may say it is a virus. This is because there is no digital signature. 
# Note For First Versions
If the application appears in the task manager even though you closed it, this is due to the "this.hide" command. You can close the application. I am working on this.
# Note For x86 Versions
With the removal of Lite versions, there will no longer be an x86 version.
